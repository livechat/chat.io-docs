# Introduction

## Overview

Chat.io Agent API allows you to join a chat as **an agent**. It has a different set of methods than the [Customer API](/docs/customer-api). The main reason to have separate APIs for both Customer and Agent are their specific use cases.

## Use cases

With chat.io Agent API you can do the following:

- build a custom Agent App
- interact with a chat as an agent (join a chat, post messages)
- browse chat archives
- ban customers

This API is used in [chat.io Agent App](https://app.chat.io/).

## Important notes

To use this tool you need to have basic knowledge of REST or websocket APIs, OAuth 2.0 protocol and your technology of choice. We've got examples ready in JavaScript, Go and Python.

If you want to perform a chat from the customer perspective, you should use [Customer API](/docs/customer-api).
